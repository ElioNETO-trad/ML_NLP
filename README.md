My personal Repo for projects focusing on Machine Learning/NLP & Automatization (Préparation/études pour l'alternance en NLP).

I'm currently in the process of reorganizing all my annotations before uploading to my repo, so it might take a while.


To update: 
* Documentation (Git, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas)
* ongoing projects : LLM running locally with API directly on the code / Youtube Summarizer / Creating GPT from scratch / simple regression/logistic models (ML/Supervised folders) / Small translation model (EN <> FR)
* My personal ML/Neural Network/NLP annotations
* Automatization scripts (Python)
* Linux documentation (Arch/Ollama + which local models I'm currently using)
